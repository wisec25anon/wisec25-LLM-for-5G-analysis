This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a service request and then 
The AMF sent gmm status to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: service request
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: gmm status
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Protected
5G-AKA: Completed
5GMM Cause: 72
UE provided: Deregistration request (UE originating)

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
7.519925117492676	UE to 	AMF	InitialUEMessage, Service request, Service request [RRCEstablishmentCause=mo-Data]
7.520439147949219	AMF to 	UE 	DownlinkNASTransport, 5GMM status (Non-3GPP access to 5GCN not allowed)
13.482510089874268	UE to 	AMF	InitialUEMessage, Service request, Service request [RRCEstablishmentCause=mo-Data]
13.482896089553833	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=15, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Service reject (UE identity cannot be derived by the network)
13.687610149383545	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Deregistration request (UE originating)
