This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a authentication response and then 
The AMF sent security mode command to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: authentication response
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: security mode command
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Plain
5G-AKA: Not completed yet
ABBA: 3200
Cipher Algorithm: 128-5G-EA1
Integrity Algorithm: 5G-IA7
Security header: Plain NAS message (0)
UE provided: No response

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
0.11983895301818848	UE to 	AMF	SACK (Ack=1, Arwnd=106496) , UplinkNASTransport, Authentication response
0.12023711204528809	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=2, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Security mode command


Did the UE behave securely? Compare the expected behavior of the UE with its actual actions. 
Please walk through your thought process and provide your chain of thoughts to reach this conclusion.
