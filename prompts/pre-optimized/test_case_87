This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a service request and then 
The AMF sent security mode command to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: service request
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: security mode command
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Plain
5G-AKA: Completed
Cipher Algorithm: 5G-EA6
Integrity Algorithm: 128-5G-IA2
Security header: Plain NAS message (0)
UE provided: No response

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
8.602246046066284	UE to 	AMF	InitialUEMessage, Service request, Service request [RRCEstablishmentCause=mo-Data]
8.602970123291016	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=17, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Security mode command


Did the UE behave securely? Compare the expected behavior of the UE with its actual actions.
