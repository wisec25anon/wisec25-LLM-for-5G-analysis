This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a identity response and then 
The AMF sent authentication request to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: identity response
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: authentication request
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Plain
5G-AKA: Not completed yet
ABBA: 3100
RAND: 313131313131313131006f90d2550000
AUTN: 35353535353535353535353535353535
ngKSI_TSC: Native security context
ngKSI_KSI: 2
UE provided: Authentication failure (ngKSI already in use)

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
0.039749860763549805	UE to 	AMF	SACK (Ack=0, Arwnd=106496) , UplinkNASTransport, Identity response
0.0399777889251709	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=1, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Authentication request
0.2409358024597168	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Authentication failure (ngKSI already in use)


Did the UE behave securely? Compare the expected behavior of the UE with its actual actions.
