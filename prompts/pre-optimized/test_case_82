This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a ul nas transport and then 
The AMF sent security mode command to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: ul nas transport
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: security mode command
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Plain
5G-AKA: Completed
ABBA: 3200
Cipher Algorithm: 5G-EA6
Integrity Algorithm: 128-5G-IA1
Security header: Plain NAS message (0)
UE provided: No response

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
5.633437156677246	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, UL NAS transport, PDU session establishment request
5.634006023406982	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=11, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Security mode command
5.634031057357788	UE to 	AMF	SACK (Ack=8, Arwnd=106454) , UplinkNASTransport, Deregistration request (UE originating)


Did the UE behave securely? Compare the expected behavior of the UE with its actual actions.
