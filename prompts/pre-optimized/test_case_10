This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a registration request and then 
The AMF sent security mode command to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: registration request
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: security mode command
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Protected
5G-AKA: Not completed yet
Cipher Algorithm: 5G-EA0 (null)
Integrity Algorithm: 5G- IA0 (null)
Security header: Integrity protected with new security context (3)
UE provided: Security mode reject (Security mode rejected, unspecified)

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
0.0	UE to 	AMF	InitialUEMessage, Registration request, Registration request [RRCEstablishmentCause=mo-Signalling]
0.0007860660552978516	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=0, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Security mode command
0.2037971019744873	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Security mode reject (Security mode rejected, unspecified)


Did the UE behave securely? Compare the expected behavior of the UE with its actual actions.
