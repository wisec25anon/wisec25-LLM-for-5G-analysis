5G-AKA: Not completed yet
UE provided: No response

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
0.03993391990661621	UE to 	AMF	SACK (Ack=0, Arwnd=106496) , UplinkNASTransport, Identity response
0.04019308090209961	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=1, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Authentication reject
