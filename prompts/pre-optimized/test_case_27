This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a identity response and then 
The AMF sent security mode command to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: identity response
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: security mode command
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Plain
5G-AKA: Not completed yet
ABBA: 3100
Cipher Algorithm: 128-5G-EA2
Integrity Algorithm: 5G- IA0 (null)
Security header: Plain NAS message (0)
UE provided: Deregistration request (UE originating)

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
0.03973889350891113	UE to 	AMF	SACK (Ack=0, Arwnd=106496) , UplinkNASTransport, Identity response
0.040254831314086914	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=1, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Security mode command
0.24545598030090332	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Deregistration request (UE originating)


Did the UE behave securely? Compare the expected behavior of the UE with its actual actions.
