This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a authentication response and then 
The AMF sent authentication request to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: authentication response
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: authentication request
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Plain
5G-AKA: Not completed yet
ABBA: 3200
RAND: 303030303030300078b457a1d8550000
AUTN: 3131313131313131310057a1d8550000
ngKSI_TSC: Native security context
ngKSI_KSI: 0
UE provided: Authentication failure (Non-5G authentication unacceptable)

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
0.11977601051330566	UE to 	AMF	SACK (Ack=1, Arwnd=106496) , UplinkNASTransport, Authentication response
0.11999082565307617	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=2, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Authentication request
0.3230268955230713	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Authentication failure (Non-5G authentication unacceptable)


Did the UE behave securely? Compare the expected behavior of the UE with its actual actions.
