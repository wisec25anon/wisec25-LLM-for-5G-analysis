This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a security mode complete and then 
The AMF sent security mode command to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: security mode complete
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: security mode command
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Plain
5G-AKA: Completed
ABBA: 3200
Cipher Algorithm: 128-5G-EA1
Integrity Algorithm: 5G-IA7
Security header: Plain NAS message (0)
UE provided: No response

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
0.11955118179321289	UE to 	AMF	SACK (Ack=1, Arwnd=106496) , UplinkNASTransport, Security mode complete, Registration request
0.11986398696899414	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=2, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Security mode command


Did the UE behave securely? Compare the expected behavior of the UE with its actual actions.
