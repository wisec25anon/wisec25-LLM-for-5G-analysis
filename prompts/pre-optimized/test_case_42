UE provided: Identity response

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
0.11984515190124512	UE to 	AMF	SACK (Ack=2, Arwnd=106496) , UplinkNASTransport, Authentication response
0.12008404731750488	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=3, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Identity request
0.32216715812683105	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Identity response
