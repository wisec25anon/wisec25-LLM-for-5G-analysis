This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a ul nas transport and then 
The AMF sent configuration update command to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: ul nas transport
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: configuration update command
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Protected
5G-AKA: Completed
Security header: Integrity protected and ciphered (2)
UE provided: Configuration update complete

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
2.4281399250030518	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Registration complete, UplinkNASTransport, UL NAS transport, PDU session establishment request
2.4283440113067627	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=11, Arwnd=106401) , DownlinkNASTransport, Configuration update command
2.428462028503418	AMF to 	UE 	DownlinkNASTransport, Configuration update command
2.6321370601654053	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Configuration update complete
