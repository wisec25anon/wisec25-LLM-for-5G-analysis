This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a registration complete and then 
The AMF sent security mode command to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: registration complete
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: security mode command
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Protected
5G-AKA: Completed
ABBA: 3000
Cipher Algorithm: 5G-EA0 (null)
Integrity Algorithm: 128-5G-IA2
Security header: Integrity protected with new security context (3)
UE provided: No response

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
0.5716309547424316	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Registration complete
0.5718338489532471	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=5, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Security mode command


Did the UE behave securely? Compare the expected behavior of the UE with its actual actions.
