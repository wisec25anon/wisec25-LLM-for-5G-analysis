This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a security mode complete and then 
The AMF sent security mode command to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: security mode complete
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: security mode command
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Protected
5G-AKA: Completed
Cipher Algorithm: 5G-EA0 (null)
Integrity Algorithm: 5G- IA0 (null)
Security header: Integrity protected with new security context (3)
UE provided: Security mode reject (Security mode rejected, unspecified)

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
0.15992307662963867	UE to 	AMF	SACK (Ack=2, Arwnd=106496) , UplinkNASTransport, Security mode complete, Registration request
0.16016101837158203	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=3, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Security mode command
0.36194396018981934	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Security mode reject (Security mode rejected, unspecified)


Did the UE behave securely? Compare the expected behavior of the UE with its actual actions.
