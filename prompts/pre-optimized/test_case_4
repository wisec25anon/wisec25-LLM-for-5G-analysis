This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a registration request and then 
The AMF sent security mode command to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: registration request
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: security mode command
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Protected
5G-AKA: Not completed yet
ABBA: 3200
Cipher Algorithm: 128-5G-EA3
Integrity Algorithm: 5G- IA0 (null)
Security header: Integrity protected with new security context (3)
UE provided: 5GMM status (Invalid mandatory information)

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
0.0	UE to 	AMF	InitialUEMessage, Registration request, Registration request [RRCEstablishmentCause=mo-Signalling]
0.0007700920104980469	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=0, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Security mode command
0.20126700401306152	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, 5GMM status (Invalid mandatory information)


Did the UE behave securely? Compare the expected behavior of the UE with its actual actions.
