This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a identity response and then 
The AMF sent security mode command to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: identity response
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: security mode command
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Protected
5G-AKA: Not completed yet
ABBA: 3232
Cipher Algorithm: 5G-EA4
Integrity Algorithm: 128-5G-IA1
Security header: Integrity protected with new security context (3)
UE provided: Security mode reject (Security mode rejected, unspecified)

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
0.03993701934814453	UE to 	AMF	SACK (Ack=0, Arwnd=106496) , UplinkNASTransport, Identity response
0.04126906394958496	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=1, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Security mode command
0.24338102340698242	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Security mode reject (Security mode rejected, unspecified)


Did the UE behave securely? Compare the expected behavior of the UE with its actual actions.
