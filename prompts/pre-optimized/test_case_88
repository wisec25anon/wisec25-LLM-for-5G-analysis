This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a service request and then 
The AMF sent security mode command to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: service request
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: security mode command
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Protected
5G-AKA: Completed
ABBA: 0000
Cipher Algorithm: 5G-EA0 (null)
Integrity Algorithm: 128-5G-IA2
Security header: Integrity protected with new security context (3)
UE provided: Security mode reject (Security mode rejected, unspecified)

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
17.321523904800415	UE to 	AMF	InitialUEMessage, Service request, Service request [RRCEstablishmentCause=mo-Data]
17.322353839874268	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=24, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Security mode command
17.532354831695557	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Security mode reject (Security mode rejected, unspecified)


Did the UE behave securely? Compare the expected behavior of the UE with its actual actions.
