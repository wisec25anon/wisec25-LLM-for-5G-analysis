This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a security mode complete and then 
The AMF sent security mode command to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: security mode complete
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: security mode command
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Protected
5G-AKA: Completed
ABBA: 3300
Cipher Algorithm: 5G-EA4
Integrity Algorithm: 5G- IA0 (null)
Security header: Integrity protected with new security context (3)
UE provided: Deregistration request (UE originating)

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
0.1600170135498047	UE to 	AMF	SACK (Ack=2, Arwnd=106496) , UplinkNASTransport, Security mode complete, Registration request
0.16026687622070312	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=3, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Security mode command
0.36418795585632324	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Deregistration request (UE originating)


Did the UE behave securely? Compare the expected behavior of the UE with its actual actions.
