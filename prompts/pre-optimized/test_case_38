This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a authentication response and then 
The AMF sent authentication request to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: authentication response
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: authentication request
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Plain
5G-AKA: Not completed yet
ABBA: 0000
RAND: 303030303030300078d431f251560000
AUTN: 4953cc15a85a90008f0a1f4e8f0a3310
ngKSI_TSC: Native security context
ngKSI_KSI: 4
UE provided: Authentication failure (MAC failure)

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
1.8795151710510254	UE to 	AMF	SACK (Ack=4, Arwnd=106496) , UplinkNASTransport, Authentication response
1.8797390460968018	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=6, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Authentication request
2.0836050510406494	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Authentication failure (MAC failure)
