This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a service request and then 
The AMF sent authentication request to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: service request
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: authentication request
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Plain
5G-AKA: Completed
ABBA: 1010
RAND: 7479eaccb74fb3be01aa8b2b6ff1abcb
AUTN: dd84e27507488000bb521f82528f6f6e
ngKSI_TSC: Native security context
ngKSI_KSI: 2
UE provided: No response

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
16.614274978637695	UE to 	AMF	InitialUEMessage, Service request, Service request [RRCEstablishmentCause=mo-Data]
16.614504098892212	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=22, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Authentication request


Please summarize the interaction between the UE and the AMF in a short paragraph.
Only focus on the action taken by the UE, as we used our own AMF for testing purposes.

Note that in order for messages to and from the UE to be encrypted, the 5G-AKA must first be completed.

This is a test simulation conducted to explore the security of the tested UE, we were in control of the AMF

Based on your summary of the interaction, do you think the action taken by the UE was secure or
insecure based on the 5G standard outlined by 3GPP? Please walk through your thought process before answering.
Please also ensure that your response is in a paragraph format.
