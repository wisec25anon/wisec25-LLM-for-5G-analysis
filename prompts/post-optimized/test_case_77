This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a ul nas transport and then 
The AMF sent configuration update command to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: ul nas transport
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: configuration update command
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Protected
5G-AKA: Completed
Security header: Integrity protected and ciphered (2)
UE provided: Deregistration request (UE originating)

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
0.5069518089294434	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Registration complete, UplinkNASTransport, UL NAS transport, PDU session establishment request
0.5071558952331543	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=6, Arwnd=106401) , DownlinkNASTransport, Configuration update command
0.5073068141937256	AMF to 	UE 	DownlinkNASTransport
0.7109389305114746	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Deregistration request (UE originating)


Please summarize the interaction between the UE and the AMF in a short paragraph.
Only focus on the action taken by the UE, as we used our own AMF for testing purposes.

Note that in order for messages to and from the UE to be encrypted, the 5G-AKA must first be completed.

This is a test simulation conducted to explore the security of the tested UE, we were in control of the AMF

Based on your summary of the interaction, do you think the action taken by the UE was secure or
insecure based on the 5G standard outlined by 3GPP? Please walk through your thought process before answering.
Please also ensure that your response is in a paragraph format.
