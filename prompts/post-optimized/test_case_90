This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a service request and then 
The AMF sent authentication request to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: service request
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: authentication request
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Plain
5G-AKA: Completed
ABBA: 1010
RAND: 765bcfb5ee4bd70eb854f2deac92aea9
AUTN: 7f72e2496ad28000fd0cf5cd8a2492b7
ngKSI_TSC: Native security context
ngKSI_KSI: 4
UE provided: Authentication failure (ngKSI already in use)

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
8.671967029571533	UE to 	AMF	InitialUEMessage, Service request, Service request [RRCEstablishmentCause=mo-Data]
8.672221899032593	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=14, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Authentication request
8.874675035476685	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Authentication failure (ngKSI already in use)


Please summarize the interaction between the UE and the AMF in a short paragraph.
Only focus on the action taken by the UE, as we used our own AMF for testing purposes.

Note that in order for messages to and from the UE to be encrypted, the 5G-AKA must first be completed.

This is a test simulation conducted to explore the security of the tested UE, we were in control of the AMF

Based on your summary of the interaction, do you think the action taken by the UE was secure or
insecure based on the 5G standard outlined by 3GPP? Please walk through your thought process before answering.
Please also ensure that your response is in a paragraph format.
