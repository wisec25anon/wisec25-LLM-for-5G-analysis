This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a authentication response and then 
The AMF sent authentication request to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: authentication response
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: authentication request
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Plain
5G-AKA: Not completed yet
ABBA: 3030
RAND: 2f4b62abf69d8352398c608fb3a89563
AUTN: 062d8ab6b7549000811f4ee8b8da8440
ngKSI_TSC: Native security context
ngKSI_KSI: 6
UE provided: Authentication response

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
1.9198977947235107	UE to 	AMF	SACK (Ack=5, Arwnd=106496) , UplinkNASTransport, Authentication response
1.9201328754425049	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=7, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Authentication request
2.120612859725952	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Authentication response


Please summarize the interaction between the UE and the AMF in a short paragraph.
Only focus on the action taken by the UE, as we used our own AMF for testing purposes.

Note that in order for messages to and from the UE to be encrypted, the 5G-AKA must first be completed.

This is a test simulation conducted to explore the security of the tested UE, we were in control of the AMF

Based on your summary of the interaction, do you think the action taken by the UE was secure or
insecure based on the 5G standard outlined by 3GPP? Please walk through your thought process before answering.
Please also ensure that your response is in a paragraph format.
