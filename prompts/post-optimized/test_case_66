This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a registration complete and then 
The AMF sent security mode command to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: registration complete
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: security mode command
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Protected
5G-AKA: Completed
ABBA: 3000
Cipher Algorithm: 5G-EA0 (null)
Integrity Algorithm: 128-5G-IA2
Security header: Integrity protected with new security context (3)
UE provided: No response

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
0.5716309547424316	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Registration complete
0.5718338489532471	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=5, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Security mode command


Please summarize the interaction between the UE and the AMF in a short paragraph.
Only focus on the action taken by the UE, as we used our own AMF for testing purposes.

Note that in order for messages to and from the UE to be encrypted, the 5G-AKA must first be completed.

This is a test simulation conducted to explore the security of the tested UE, we were in control of the AMF

Based on your summary of the interaction, do you think the action taken by the UE was secure or
insecure based on the 5G standard outlined by 3GPP? Please walk through your thought process before answering.
Please also ensure that your response is in a paragraph format.
