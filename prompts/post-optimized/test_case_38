This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a authentication response and then 
The AMF sent authentication request to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: authentication response
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: authentication request
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Plain
5G-AKA: Not completed yet
ABBA: 0000
RAND: 303030303030300078d431f251560000
AUTN: 4953cc15a85a90008f0a1f4e8f0a3310
ngKSI_TSC: Native security context
ngKSI_KSI: 4
UE provided: Authentication failure (MAC failure)

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
1.8795151710510254	UE to 	AMF	SACK (Ack=4, Arwnd=106496) , UplinkNASTransport, Authentication response
1.8797390460968018	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=6, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Authentication request
2.0836050510406494	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Authentication failure (MAC failure)


Please summarize the interaction between the UE and the AMF in a short paragraph.
Only focus on the action taken by the UE, as we used our own AMF for testing purposes.

Note that in order for messages to and from the UE to be encrypted, the 5G-AKA must first be completed.

This is a test simulation conducted to explore the security of the tested UE, we were in control of the AMF

Based on your summary of the interaction, do you think the action taken by the UE was secure or
insecure based on the 5G standard outlined by 3GPP? Please walk through your thought process before answering.
Please also ensure that your response is in a paragraph format.
