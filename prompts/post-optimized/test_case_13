This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a registration request and then 
The AMF sent identity request to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: registration request
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: identity request
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Plain
5G-AKA: Not completed yet
Requested identity from the UE: No Identity
UE provided: Identity response

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
0.0	UE to 	AMF	InitialUEMessage, Registration request, Registration request [RRCEstablishmentCause=mo-Signalling]
0.00035309791564941406	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=0, Arwnd=106496) , DownlinkNASTransport, Identity request
0.2037191390991211	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Identity response


Please summarize the interaction between the UE and the AMF in a short paragraph.
Only focus on the action taken by the UE, as we used our own AMF for testing purposes.

Note that in order for messages to and from the UE to be encrypted, the 5G-AKA must first be completed.

This is a test simulation conducted to explore the security of the tested UE, we were in control of the AMF

Based on your summary of the interaction, do you think the action taken by the UE was secure or
insecure based on the 5G standard outlined by 3GPP? Please walk through your thought process before answering.
Please also ensure that your response is in a paragraph format.
