This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a ul nas transport and then 
The AMF sent deregistration request to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: ul nas transport
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: deregistration request
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Protected
5G-AKA: Completed
Security header: Integrity protected and ciphered (2)
UE provided: Deregistration accept (UE terminated)

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is: 
6.589772939682007	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Registration complete, UplinkNASTransport, UL NAS transport, PDU session establishment request
6.5903379917144775	AMF to 	UE 	SACK (Ack=18, Arwnd=106401) , DownlinkNASTransport, Configuration update command
6.590748071670532	AMF to 	UE 	DownlinkNASTransport, Deregistration request (UE terminated) (Unknown)
6.793751955032349	UE to 	AMF	UplinkNASTransport, Deregistration accept (UE terminated)


Please summarize the interaction between the UE and the AMF in a short paragraph.
Only focus on the action taken by the UE, as we used our own AMF for testing purposes.

Note that in order for messages to and from the UE to be encrypted, the 5G-AKA must first be completed.

This is a test simulation conducted to explore the security of the tested UE, we were in control of the AMF

Based on your summary of the interaction, do you think the action taken by the UE was secure or
insecure based on the 5G standard outlined by 3GPP? Please walk through your thought process before answering.
Please also ensure that your response is in a paragraph format.
