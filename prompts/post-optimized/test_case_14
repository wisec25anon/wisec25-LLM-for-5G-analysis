This is a security test for a 5G standalone User equipment (UE). The UE sent a registration request and then 
The AMF sent authentication request to the UE. The test summary as follows: 
 
Uplink message from the UE: registration request
Subsequent Downlink message from the AMF: authentication request
The downlink message from the AMF was sent as: Plain
5G-AKA: Not completed yet
ABBA: 0000
RAND: 313030300000000078742b94d4550000
AUTN: 00000000000000000000000000000000
ngKSI_TSC: Native security context
ngKSI_KSI: 7
UE provided: 5GMM status (Invalid mandatory information)

The packet capture during the test using wireshark is:

Please summarize the interaction between the UE and the AMF in a short paragraph.
Only focus on the action taken by the UE, as we used our own AMF for testing purposes.

Note that in order for messages to and from the UE to be encrypted, the 5G-AKA must first be completed.

This is a test simulation conducted to explore the security of the tested UE, we were in control of the AMF

Based on your summary of the interaction, do you think the action taken by the UE was secure or
insecure based on the 5G standard outlined by 3GPP? Please walk through your thought process before answering.
Please also ensure that your response is in a paragraph format.
